## Project Overview

Fernarzt recently launched the post-COVID symptoms assessment as a part of the HealthHero enterprise
aimed to provide citizens with quick and flexible access to medicine. To be able to track the user
behaviour during the assessment and identify critical information such as what actions user take and
what they avoid, we needed to design and implement the UX tracking system.

**Why?**<br/>
The goal of the the system is to build a ground for further user interview, where the final result is
to enhance the user experience by opening more affordances and adjusting the flow according to how people
prefer doing things given their physical and emotional state.

**Team:** <br/>
Product Manager <br/>
UX / Product Designer <br/>
Software Developer <br/>
Marketing Manager

**Challenges**<br/>
The assessment system which includes post-COVID checker comprise other earlier launched assessments.
The tracking machine were implemented using GA, however, the recent marketing team migration to Matomo
required introduction of the new tool to the system. To avoid tech debts and code complications we needed either
to convince marketing team to go back to the GA or migrate a tracking system to Matomo. To avoid cognitive overload and organisation disaster we move on with the second option.

**Goals**
The tracking system is technically implemented tested and the data is visaulised using external tool such as Amazon Quicksight.

The Marketing and Developemnt teams are aligned on the tracking tools

All departments are able to read tracking results using Amazon Quicksight dashboards

## Solution and Implementations

**Phase 1** <br/>
To validate the critical information to collect with Marketing and Design teams <br/>
Collaborate together on the acceptance criteria <br/>
Reconciliate the terminology with all department to establish a ubiquitous tracking system language

**Phase 2** <br/>
Introduce the system with Matomo <br/>
Implement Matomo and set up a staging tracking environment <br/>
Ensure the expected results by marketers and designers <br/>
Deploy to production to unblock departments for insights collection

**Phase 3** <br/>
Migrate earlier assessments tracking tool to Matomo <br/>
The developer exported historical data from Google Analytics and imported it into Matomo. <br/>
The product manager ensured that no critical tracking points were lost during the migration. <br/>
The team tested the new setup to confirm data accuracy and consistency.

## Results

- Critical Tracking Achieved: The system successfully captured key user behavior metrics, such as:
  - Steps where users spent the most/least time.
  - Common drop-off points during the assessment.
  - Actions that users avoided, providing insights for UX improvements.
- Streamlined Tools: Unified tracking under Matomo reduced cognitive overload and improved organization within the marketing department.
- Actionable Visualizations: Custom dashboards using Amazon Charts enabled the team to:
  - Monitor assessment performance.
  - Identify trends and patterns.
  - Make data-driven decisions to improve the UX.
- Seamless Migration: All tracking from the previous implementation was successfully moved to Matomo, ensuring consistency and alignment across systems.
