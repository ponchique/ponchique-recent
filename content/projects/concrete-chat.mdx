## Overview

TodoChat is a specialised task chat app designed to streamline communication in the construction industry.
It organizes task-specific conversations, media, and documents into dedicated chats, reducing the clutter of traditional group messaging apps.
By leveraging photo-driven workflows and an intuitive chat interface, TodoChat helps workers and managers collaborate efficiently on-site and off-site.

## Problem

Construction workers and managers rely heavily on group chats like WhatsApp for task coordination,
but these platforms quickly become disorganized. Critical photos, messages, and updates get buried
in unrelated conversations, making tracking progress or retrieving information difficult.
This inefficiency wastes time and leads to missed details and errors, creating frustration for teams.

## Research Insights

**Construction Workers:** <br/>
Struggle with messy chats and retrieving task-related photos or instructions.
Prefer mobile-friendly tools due to on-site mobility.

**Managers:** <br/>
Need a web option for better task monitoring and coordination.
Value tools that integrate with existing project management systems.

## TodoChat simplifies communication by:

- Creating Task-Specific Chats: Each task gets its own dedicated chat, keeping conversations and media organized.
- Photo-Driven Task Creation: Workers can create tasks directly from their photos, a common action on construction sites.
- Centralizing Media and Documents: All files related to a task are stored in one place for easy access.
- Adapting to Workflows: Mobile-first for workers, with a web option for managers who need a broader overview.
- Providing Scalability: The app can integrate into existing workflows and scale to meet the needs of larger teams or enterprises.
