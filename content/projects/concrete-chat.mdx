## Overview

ConcreteChat is a specialised task chat app designed to streamline communication in the construction industry.
It organizes task-specific conversations, media, and documents into dedicated chats, reducing the clutter of traditional group messaging apps.
By leveraging photo-driven workflows and an intuitive chat interface, ConcreteChat helps workers and managers collaborate efficiently on-site and off-site.

## Problem

Construction workers and managers rely heavily on group chats like WhatsApp for task coordination,
but these platforms quickly become disorganized. Critical photos, messages, and updates get buried
in unrelated conversations, making tracking progress or retrieving information difficult.
This inefficiency wastes time and leads to missed details and errors, creating frustration for teams.

## Research Insights

**Construction Workers:** <br/>
Struggle with messy chats and retrieving task-related photos or instructions.
Prefer mobile-friendly tools due to on-site mobility.

**Managers:** <br/>
Need a web option for better task monitoring and coordination.
Value tools that integrate with existing project management systems.

## User Story

**Worker On-Site:** <br/>
A construction worker spots a damaged beam on-site and snaps a photo.
Using TodoChat, they create a new task, attach the photo, and add a brief description.
The app creates a dedicated chat for the task, where the worker and manager can discuss the issue.

**Manager Off-Site:** <br/>
The manager accesses the task on their web dashboard, adds the necessary blueprints, and assigns team members to resolve the issue.
All updates and media related to the task are stored in the chat for easy reference.
